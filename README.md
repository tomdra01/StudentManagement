# 7. Modify the Course Credits relation - EF

So EF by default would generate a migration with destructive approach. This means it would change int to decimal(65,30) where we could lost some already existing data in the table.

Thats why I decided to use non-destructive approach and after creating a migration file, editing the default decimal(65,30) to decimal(5,2). This way we wont have any data loss.

Commands used:

```
dotnet ef migrations add ModifyCreditsType
dotnet ef database update
dotnet ef migrations script AddDepartment ModifyCreditsType -o Scripts/V7__ModifyCreditsType.sql
```
